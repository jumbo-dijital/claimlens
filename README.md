# ClaimLens

> **The claims assessment co-pilot** — an AI-powered platform that streamlines the manual review, damage assessment, and estimate generation steps in car insurance claims.

ClaimLens helps claims agents turn policyholder-supplied vehicle damage photos into fast, consistent, evidence-backed repair estimates — with a human always in the loop. It is a **proof-of-concept** built to demonstrate how AI can reduce assessment time, improve estimate consistency, and lower operational cost per claim.

## 🤖 Managed by Lovable

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository is primarily managed by [Lovable](https://lovable.dev).**
>
> The application is built and edited through Lovable, and **commits are merged from Lovable whenever it makes changes to the app**. As a result:
>
> - Lovable is the source of truth for most application code.
> - Expect automated commits authored by Lovable to land on the main branch.
> - When making manual changes, coordinate with the Lovable workflow to avoid conflicts — changes made outside of Lovable may be overwritten or need to be reconciled on the next Lovable sync.
> - Project metadata lives in [`.lovable/`](.lovable/) (see [`.lovable/plan.md`](.lovable/plan.md) for the product/build plan).

## ✨ What it does

ClaimLens supports three personas, selectable via a user switcher in the top-right (no real authentication — this is a prototype):

| Persona | Who | What they do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 👩‍💼 **Claims Agent** | _Sarah_ | Reviews claims and damage photos, reviews/edits AI-generated estimates, submits for approval |
| 🧑‍⚖️ **Senior Adjuster** | _Tom_ | Reviews submitted assessments — approve, reject, or send back for changes |
| 🛠️ **Superadmin** | — | Generates synthetic claims, including AI-generated damage images, to populate the demo |

### Core workflow

1. **Review images** — Agent selects a claim and views policyholder damage photos, organised by angle, with quality flags for low-res or missing shots.
2. **AI assessment** — AI analyses the images and returns detected damage types, suggested parts/labour, per-line-item cost estimates, and confidence levels.
3. **Human-in-the-loop edits** — Agent accepts or overrides AI suggestions; overrides require a rationale note that is logged for audit.
4. **Submit for approval** — One-click submission moves the case to a supervisor summary view.
5. **Supervisor review** — Senior adjuster approves, rejects, or sends back with comments.
6. **Estimate export** — On approval, generate or export an itemised estimate for downstream processing.
7. **Audit trail** — Every AI run, human edit, and approval is logged for compliance and analytics.

## 🚀 Getting started

> Most development happens in Lovable. The steps below are for running the app locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (this repo uses `bun.lock`)
- Node.js 22+ (for tooling compatibility)
- A Supabase / Lovable Cloud project and a Lovable AI Gateway key

### Install & run

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the dev server
bun run dev
```

### Available scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Start the Vite dev server |
| `bun run build` | Production build |
| `bun run build:dev` | Development-mode build |
| `bun run preview` | Preview the production build |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `bun run format` | Format with Prettier |

### Environment variables

> [!NOTE]
> The `.env` file in this repository is **not for secrets**. It only contains publicly publishable configuration values (e.g., Supabase URL and publishable key). Real secrets such as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `LOVABLE_API_KEY` are stored in Lovable Cloud's secret store and injected at runtime — they should never be committed to version control.

Create a `.env` file (see existing variable names) with at least:

| Variable | Scope | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Public (client) | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Public (client) | Supabase anon/publishable key |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | Public (client) | Supabase project ID |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Server | Supabase project URL (SSR) |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Server | Supabase anon/publishable key (SSR) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **Server secret** | Service-role key — **never expose to the client** |
| `LOVABLE_API_KEY` | **Server secret** | Lovable AI Gateway key for vision analysis & image generation |

> [!WARNING]
> Variables prefixed with `VITE_` are **bundled into the browser build** and are public by design. Only the Supabase anon/publishable key belongs there. Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `LOVABLE_API_KEY` **server-side only** (read via `process.env` inside server functions/handlers — see [`src/lib/config.server.ts`](src/lib/config.server.ts)).
